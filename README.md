Crypto-economic product management

Network of crypto-economically managed product investments

# Management is a service provided to teams

Agile and Lean talk a lot about self organizing teams within an organization.
Let's self organize without a management structure earning the exponential
profits. Let's build a crypto-economic system that provides the constraints we
need to work together and stop depending on corperate management.

# Risk pooling is a service to stakeholders

Most products fail finantially and so working for or purchasing a stake in the
the finantial success of just one product is risky. Angels get around this and
pool their risk by investing in many products that each have a chance of
covering the whole investment. Let's do this with our own stakes in the products
we are building by tokenizing our stake in the products we build then join a
risk pool market. If angels want to buy in too so be it, let them, but let's not
depend on them for that risk pooling.

# Product and project discovery

Developers looking for products to contribute to will want a place to search.
People with product ideas or who want help on their products will want a place
to list.
